# Ags Configuration

This configuration aims to provide a shell replacement for compositors/window
managers. Features constantly get added and existing ones get improved.

This builds upon my [previous work on Eww](../eww).

## ‚ùî Usage

Still work in progress, so the configuration is not handled through Home Manager
yet. You can do `ln -s ~/path/to/config/ags ~/.config/ags` to link it into your
home directory, but you'll have to add the dependencies manually (listed in
`default.nix`, under the `dependencies` key).
