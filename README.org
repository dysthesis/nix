#+title: NixOS configurations

* Structure
[[file:flake.nix][The flake]] manages the inputs for the configurations, the repositories where the packages necessary would come from.

From that, the hosts are the first gateways to the actual configurations themselves, used to define per-device configurations.

** Hosts
This is where per-device configurations are defined, including hardware-specific configurations, such as filesystems and drivers. This is where the system and home configurations are imported too.

| Hostname | Display  | Filesystem | Additional notes |
|----------+----------+------------+------------------|
| phobos   | Hyprland | ZFS        | Impermanence, Lanzaboote |

** System
Self-explanatory, defines system-wide configuration.

- [[file:system/general][General configurations]]
- [[file:system/network][Network:]] For all network-related configurations, including Wi-Fi and Bluetooth.
- [[file:system/wayland/][Wayland:]] Defines configurations for a Wayland display.
- [[file:system/sound][Sound:]] Sound-specific configurations, including Pipewire.
- [[file:system/security][Security:]] Security-related configurations such as AppArmor, Sudo, PAM, kernel hardening, etc.
- [[file:system/services][Services:]] For all the services that makes life easier.
